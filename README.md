# dimensional-reporting
A dimensional analysis of final inspection data.

## Code
See `/Notebooks/Scripts/helpers.py` for the mapping and manipulation of DataFrames and plots.<br>
See `/Notebooks/seal_sleeves.ipynb` for the application of `helpers.py`.

## Context
Company X has acquired a new, custom quality control program that technicians will use to dimensionally inspect new parts. Given that this new program can collect more inspection data than ever before, it is in Company X's best interest to understand how to interpret and use the data to their advantage. This analysis will search for patterns across multiple seal sleeve inspections so that future manufacturing drawings can apply statistically sound engineering tolerances.
